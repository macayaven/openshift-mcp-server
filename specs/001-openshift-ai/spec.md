# Feature Specification: OpenShift AI Capabilities

**Feature Branch**: `001-openshift-ai`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add OpenShift AI Capabilities @Kubernetes_MCP_Server_Tools_Analysis.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Data Science Project Management (Priority: P1)

Data scientists need to create, manage, and collaborate on data science projects within OpenShift AI environments. They want to organize their work, allocate resources, and control access to their projects.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for all AI/ML workloads - projects are the organizational unit for data science activities

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a data science project, verifying its properties, and deleting it - delivers basic project organization capabilities

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has OpenShift AI access, **When** they create a data science project, **Then** the project is created with appropriate resources and permissions
2. **Given** existing data science projects, **When** they list all projects, **Then** they see their accessible projects with metadata
3. **Given** a data science project, **When** they delete it, **Then** the project and all contained resources are properly cleaned up

### User Story 2 - Jupyter Notebook Management (Priority: P1)

Data scientists need to launch, manage, and collaborate using Jupyter notebook servers for interactive development and experimentation with ML models.

**Why this priority**: Primary development environment for data scientists - essential for model development and experimentation

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching a notebook server, accessing it, stopping it, and verifying resource management - delivers interactive development capabilities

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a data science project, **When** they launch a Jupyter notebook server, **Then** the server starts with appropriate compute resources
2. **Given** running notebook servers, **When** they list servers in their project, **Then** they see server status and access information
3. **Given** a notebook server, **When** they stop or delete it, **Then** resources are properly released and work is saved

### User Story 3 - Model Serving Deployment (Priority: P2)

ML engineers need to deploy trained models as scalable endpoints for inference, with support for different model formats and scaling capabilities.

**Why this priority**: Critical for production ML workloads - enables model deployment and serving at scale

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying a model, verifying endpoint availability, checking scaling behavior, and updating the model - delivers model serving capabilities

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trained model, **When** they deploy it as a serving endpoint, **Then** the endpoint becomes available with appropriate scaling
2. **Given** deployed model services, **When** they list all serving deployments, **Then** they see service status and metrics
3. **Given** a model deployment, **When** they update the model version, **Then** the service updates without downtime

---

### User Story 4 - AI Pipeline Management (Priority: P2)

ML engineers need to create, execute, and monitor ML pipelines for training, evaluation, and deployment workflows using OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton).

**Why this priority**: Enables automated ML workflows - essential for reproducible ML operations

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a pipeline, running it, monitoring execution, and checking results - delivers pipeline orchestration capabilities

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** ML pipeline definitions, **When** they create and run a pipeline, **Then** the pipeline executes with proper resource allocation
2. **Given** running pipelines, **When** they monitor pipeline status, **Then** they see real-time execution progress and logs
3. **Given** completed pipeline runs, **When** they view pipeline results, **Then** they can access artifacts and metrics

---

### User Story 5 - GPU Resource Management (Priority: P3)

Data scientists and ML engineers need to discover, allocate, and monitor GPU resources for training and inference workloads.

**Why this priority**: Essential for performance-intensive ML workloads - enables efficient GPU utilization

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by listing available GPU resources, requesting GPU allocation, and monitoring usage - delivers GPU resource visibility and control

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** cluster with GPU nodes, **When** they list GPU resources, **Then** they see available GPU types and utilization
2. **Given** GPU resource requirements, **When** they request GPU allocation for workloads, **Then** resources are properly assigned and tracked
3. **Given** GPU-utilizing workloads, **When** they monitor GPU usage, **Then** they see real-time utilization metrics

### Edge Cases

- What happens when OpenShift AI is not installed or available in the cluster?
- How does system handle quota limits for GPU resources and project resource constraints?
- How does system handle concurrent access to shared notebook servers or model deployments?
- What happens when pipeline runs fail or encounter resource constraints?
