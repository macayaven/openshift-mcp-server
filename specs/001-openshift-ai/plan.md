# Implementation Plan: OpenShift AI Capabilities

**Branch**: `001-openshift-ai` | **Date**: 2025-10-28 | **Spec**: [OpenShift AI Capabilities](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-openshift-ai/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature adds comprehensive OpenShift AI capabilities to the Kubernetes MCP Server, enabling data scientists and ML engineers to manage AI/ML workloads through MCP tools. The implementation will add two new toolsets (openshift-ai, ai-resources) with support for data science projects, Jupyter notebooks, model serving, AI pipelines, and GPU resource management. The solution extends the existing toolset architecture while maintaining constitutional principles of native implementation, comprehensive testing, and security-first design.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Go 1.24  
**Primary Dependencies**: Kubernetes client-go, MCP Go library, Cobra CLI, OpenShift AI client libraries  
**Storage**: Kubernetes API server (no local storage)  
**Testing**: Go testing package with envtest for Kubernetes integration, OpenShift AI API mocking  
**Target Platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows (amd64, arm64)  
**Project Type**: Single Go binary with toolset architecture  
**Performance Goals**: Low-latency Kubernetes API interactions, concurrent multi-cluster support, real-time GPU metrics  
**Constraints**: No external CLI dependencies, must support read-only mode, secure by default, OpenShift AI detection  
**Scale/Scope**: MCP server for AI assistants, supporting multiple Kubernetes clusters with OpenShift AI workloads

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Native Implementation**: Must use Go Kubernetes client libraries, no CLI wrappers
- **Toolset Architecture**: Must organize tools into logical toolsets with proper registration
- **Multi-Platform Distribution**: Must support binary distribution across platforms
- **Test-First Development**: Must include comprehensive tests before implementation
- **Security & Access Control**: Must implement proper authentication and authorization

**Status**: ✅ All constitutional requirements satisfied - no violations identified

**Post-Phase 1 Re-evaluation**: ✅ Still compliant - design follows all constitutional principles

**Structure Decision**: Extending existing toolset architecture with two new toolsets (openshift-ai, ai-resources) following established patterns. New packages follow existing naming conventions and integrate with current toolset registration system.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

No constitutional violations identified. The implementation follows established patterns and extends existing architecture without introducing unnecessary complexity.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
