# Tasks: OpenShift AI Capabilities

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-openshift-ai/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Kubernetes MCP Server**: `pkg/` for packages, `cmd/` for entry point, `tests/` for all tests
- **Package structure**: `pkg/{domain}/` for domain-specific packages (api, kubernetes, mcp, etc.)
- **Toolsets**: `pkg/toolsets/{name}/` for toolset-specific implementations
- **Tests**: `tests/{type}/` where type is contract, integration, or unit
- Paths shown below follow Go project conventions - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2/US3 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with other stories but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tool definitions before client implementations
- Client implementations before tool implementations
- Tool implementations before registration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tool definition tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All client implementation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All tool implementation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tool definitions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create DataScienceProject tool definitions in pkg/api/datascience_project.go"

# Launch all client implementations for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create DataScienceProject client implementation in pkg/openshift-ai/datascience_project.go"

# Launch all tool implementations for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement datascience_projects_list tool in pkg/toolsets/openshift-ai/datascience_projects.go"
Task: "Implement datascience_project_get tool in pkg/toolsets/openshift-ai/datascience_projects.go"
Task: "Implement datascience_project_create tool in pkg/toolsets/openshift-ai/datascience_projects.go"
Task: "Implement datascience_project_delete tool in pkg/toolsets/openshift-ai/datascience_projects.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Data Science Project Management
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Data Science Project Management)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Jupyter Notebook Management)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Model Serving Deployment)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (AI Pipeline Management)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (GPU Resource Management)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (if tests requested)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
